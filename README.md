# 📊 Stock Return and Portfolio Analysis in R

## 💡 Project Overview

This project conducts an in-depth **Stock Return and Portfolio Analysis** using **R**. It focuses on evaluating daily stock returns, building efficient portfolios, and applying the **Fama-French Three-Factor Model**. The analysis includes:  

- **Log Return Calculations** for Microsoft (MSFT), 3M (MMM), and Intel (INTC) from 2012-2018.  
- **Descriptive Statistics** and **Correlation Analysis** between the stocks.  
- **Regression Analysis** using **Fama-French factors** (Market Excess Return, SMB, HML).  
- **Portfolio Optimization** using the **Sharpe Ratio** and **Efficient Frontier** plotting.  
- **Simulation tasks** with R loops and conditionals (e.g., a Pokémon card collection game).  

This project demonstrates my skills in **financial analysis**, **data visualization**, and **R programming** for quantitative finance. 📈📉

## 📊 Key Analyses & Visualizations

1. **Descriptive Statistics:**  
   - Min, Max, Mean, Median, SD, Skewness, and Kurtosis for each stock.  

2. **Correlation Matrix:**  
   - Heatmap showing relationships between MSFT, MMM, and INTC returns.  

3. **Regression Models:**  
   - **CAPM** and **Fama-French 3-Factor Model** regressions for each stock.  

4. **Portfolio Optimization:**  
   - **Sharpe Ratio** calculations (with/without short sales).  
   - **Efficient Frontier** plotting 500 optimal portfolios.  

5. **Bonus Simulations:**  
   - R loops and conditionals for pattern printing and a Pokémon card collection simulation.
